; This names the dependencies the image holds, and the image computed its
; classpath from a copy of this file when it was built. cyber-dojo.sh reads that
; baked classpath, not this file, so adding a dependency here does not put it on
; the classpath of a test run. Nothing could be added in any case: a kata runs
; with no network, so the only jars to be had are the ones already in the image.
;
; Adding source and test files does work, and needs nothing here. The kata's own
; directory is on the classpath, so a test file can require a source file beside
; it, and cyber-dojo.sh names every file matching *_test.clj. Name files for the
; exercise being done; nothing anywhere expects the names this start-point ships.
;
; The image resolves the newest stable clojure when it is built and records it
; in /versions.json, which is what says authoritatively which version a kata
; is running. The number below is a copy of it made when this file was last
; edited, so read /versions.json if the two ever disagree.
